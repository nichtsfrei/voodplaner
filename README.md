# voodplaner

`voodplaner` is a vegan food planing program.

It's goal is to:
- get an overview how much energy and supplements you need.
- compare meals to the providing factor of those

To then make educated decisions what you need to supplement.

The idea is to have somewhat hard coded requirement matrix (voodplaner-requirements) and compare it against user driven data (nutrient factor of ingredients) as well as recipied (that uses ingredients).


Currently planned user facing programs:
- ios (mobile)
- cli (laptop, pc)
- http based service (allows building web services)

The main focus currently is on the cli as it it is easiest to reach.
